# projects
# This project contains three python scripts, which in default mode let you train a pre-trained neural network architecture
# on a set of images and in the second step makes a guess on which label a optional image has.
# train.py trains the model on the images you put in and saves the model to a file you can choose. 
# predict.py takes in a image and then predicts which label that images has based on the process from train.py
# functions.py is needed for both train.py and predict.py
# The html file contains the code in a jupyter notebook
